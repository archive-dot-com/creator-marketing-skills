# Creator Marketing Skills

AI-powered skills for creator marketing teams at consumer brands and agencies. Built for [Archive](https://archive.com).

## What This Is

A collection of Claude Code skills that automate the repetitive, manual work in creator marketing — writing briefs, vetting creators, generating reports, crafting outreach, and more. Each skill encodes real creator marketing expertise so the output is ready to use, not just a starting point.

## Who It's For

- **Brands** running creator programs (beauty, fashion, wellness, food, lifestyle)
- **Agencies** managing creator campaigns for brand clients
- From solo founders sourcing their first creators to Enterprise VPs managing thousands of partnerships

## Getting Started

**Start here: run `/brand-context` first.** This skill scrapes your brand's website and asks a few creator-marketing-specific questions to build a shared context file. Every other skill reads this file automatically — so you only describe your brand once.

```
/brand-context
```

After that, use any skill and it will already know your brand, audience, platforms, and goals.
