# Target Audience Brief: Creator Marketing Skills

## Who These Skills Are For

Archive is a creator marketing platform built for consumer brands and the agencies that serve them. The 15 creator marketing skills in this repo are designed for the same audience — marketing teams at brands and agencies who run creator programs as a core part of their go-to-market, across every stage of maturity.

## Primary Audience: Consumer Brands

The strongest fit is consumer brands selling physical products DTC or omnichannel — beauty, fashion, wellness, food, lifestyle, and jewelry in particular. These are companies where brand storytelling and creator content are central to how they reach customers, not a side experiment. The skills assume users who already believe in creator marketing and need better tools to execute it.

Within brands, the target users sit in marketing, social, influencer, community, e-commerce, and brand partnership roles. At **SMB companies** (under $50M revenue, under 50 employees, under 100K Instagram followers), the user is often the founder, CEO, or a solo marketing generalist wearing every hat. Their top priority is sourcing new creators and getting campaigns off the ground — they're building their influencer programs from scratch. Skills like Campaign Brief Generator, Creator Discovery, and Outreach Writer hit hardest here.

At **Mid-Market** ($50M+ revenue or 50+ employees or 100K+ followers), the user is typically a Director or Head of Influencer/Social with a small team. There are two distinct personas: influencer teams focused on content capture, reporting, and proving ROI, and social teams focused on social listening and community engagement at scale (1,000–10,000+ UGC pieces per month). Skills like End-of-Campaign Report Generator, Content Brief Builder, Creator Vetting Scorecard, and Trend Research Assistant map directly to their daily pain points.

At **Enterprise** ($1B+ revenue or 1,000+ employees or 5M+ followers), the user is VP+ overseeing a large creator operation. Creator vetting is the single biggest business case — brands pay agencies $200+ per creator for manual vetting. Enterprise social teams also need trend intelligence and competitive analysis at volume. Skills like Competitor Creator Audit, Creator Vetting Scorecard, and the Ambassador Program Blueprint serve this tier.

## Secondary Audience: Agencies

The skills also serve influencer marketing, social, and PR agencies — particularly those with creator campaigns and brand partnerships as a core service. At agencies, the highest-value contacts are client-facing: Account Directors, Partnership Managers, and senior account leads who directly manage creator programs for their brand clients.

SMB agencies building their creator practice need the same discovery and outreach tools as SMB brands. Mid-Market and Enterprise agencies (including those under the Big 6 holding companies: Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, IPG, Havas, Dentsu) need efficiency at scale — vetting creators faster, generating briefs without starting from scratch, and building campaign reports without manual data entry.

## What They Have in Common

Across all segments, the target user runs creator programs hands-on or manages the team that does. They deal daily with creator discovery, outreach, briefing, contract negotiation, content tracking, compliance, and reporting. They're time-constrained, often managing 20–200+ creator relationships simultaneously, and spend too much of their day on repetitive operational work — screenshotting stories, tracking in Excel, hunting for posts manually.

The skills intentionally map to the creator marketing workflow: early-stage users (SMB) get the most value from sourcing, outreach, and campaign setup. Growth-stage users (Mid-Market) benefit from content tracking, reporting, and integration-ready outputs. Mature programs (Enterprise) lean on vetting, competitive intelligence, and strategic planning.

## Who These Skills Are NOT For

B2B companies, distributors, wholesalers, EdTech, pure infrastructure businesses, and companies with no consumer-facing brand or creator relevance. Also not for execution-only roles (designers, copywriters, interns) or departments outside marketing (sales, finance, HR, IT, legal). The skills assume a user who already has or is actively building a creator program.
