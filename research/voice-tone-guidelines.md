# Archive Writing & Messaging Guidelines

November 2025 (updated)

This document defines **how Archive writes and speaks across all channels** *and* how we talk about the product itself.

It combines:

- A global **editorial & style guide** (Part A)
- An Archive-specific **product messaging & positioning guide** (Part B)

Use **Part A** for *how* to write (tone, grammar, structure).
Use **Part B** for *what* to say (category, product areas, language, guardrails).

> Scope note:
These guidelines primarily cover Archive blog / SEO articles, Academy content, help docs, and product-adjacent writing.
>
> - Product launch pages, ads, and highly visual campaigns may have additional rules from PMM/design.
> - Case studies follow this voice, but are usually less cheeky than other content.

## Part A – Editorial Voice & Craft

### 1. Core Voice Principles

### 1.1 Primary voice attributes

Archive's voice should feel like a **modern, data-savvy marketing colleague** who understands UGC, creator marketing, and e-commerce inside and out.

- We sound like someone who has:
    - Tried the workflow
    - Looked at the metrics
    - Seen the pain of manual hacks
    - And wants the reader to win

We balance these five tensions:

1. **Friendly, but not overly familiar**
    - We sound like a smart colleague who lives online, not like a group-chat best friend.
    - Natural, conversational, and emoji-friendly when appropriate.
    - Never clingy, performative, or over-sharing.
2. **Simple, but not condescending**
    - We explain things clearly and plainly — we want to help.
    - We assume our readers are skilled marketers, social managers, and e-commerce operators.
    - We don't dumb things down or over-explain the basics.
3. **Aspirational, but not delusional**
    - We talk about real outcomes (more revenue, deeper relationships, less manual work).
    - We don't guarantee results or promise magic.
    - We emphasize "this is what's possible," not "this will definitely happen for everyone."
4. **Understanding, but still professional**
    - We empathize with messy creator spreadsheets, missed Stories, and tight launch timelines.
    - We don't pretend to know customers personally or speak on their behalf.
5. **AI-obsessed, but deeply human**
    - We live and breathe AI; it enables marketers to do more while allowing brands to win big.
    - We share executives' excitement about how AI can increase efficiency and build profit.
    - We are sensitive about people's AI insecurities; we don't want to replace humans, we want to help them love their jobs again.

### 1.2 The Archive voice *is*

- **Clear & direct** — Lead with what matters. Avoid long build-ups.
- **Technically confident** — Fluent in UGC, EMV, CTR, creator programs, short-form platforms, and e-commerce terms.
- **Data-driven & grounded** — We reference real workflows, metrics, and use cases.
- **Human & approachable** — Conversational and easy to read.
- **Respectful of expertise** — We assume the reader understands marketing and social.
- **Person-first** — Default to "you" and "your team."
- **Solution-oriented** — We focus on workflows, outcomes, and "what to do next."
- **Calmly confident** — We know what we're doing. We don't shout about it or oversell.

### 1.3 The Archive voice is *not*

- Not overly casual
- Not condescending — avoid "simply," "just," or "easy"
- Not hype-driven — no "revolutionary," "game-changing," "10x overnight"
- Not academic
- Not pessimistic or fear-based
- Not buzzword-heavy
- Not self-absorbed — the hero is the customer

### 1.4 Voice in practice

**Good:**
> "Shoppable UGC Feeds turn your best short-form videos into on-site social proof. Connect your products, copy and paste the code block, and watch your feed update automatically as new UGC comes in."

**Bad:**
> "Our revolutionary widget will blow your mind and instantly 10x your revenue with no effort at all."

### 1.5 Inclusive & accessible writing

- Use gender-neutral language by default.
- Vary names and examples to reflect a global audience.
- Avoid culture-specific idioms that don't travel well.
- Include alt text for all meaningful images.

### 1.6 Cheeky & self-aware tone

- Light, self-aware lines are welcome as **seasoning, not the main dish**
- 1–3 moments per piece is usually enough
- Avoid inside jokes or memes only a tiny subset would get

### 2. Language & Grammar Rules

### 2.1 Technical terminology

- Define acronyms on first use: EMV, UGC, CTR
- Use the same term consistently within a piece
- Prefer specific over vague

### 2.2 Archive-specific terms & capitalization

- **Archive** — the company and product
- **Archive's AI** — always possessive
- Product areas: **Social Listening**, **Creator Activations**, **Social Flirting**
- Features: Super Search, Smart AI Fields, Brand Safety Vetting, Creator Search, etc.

### 2.3 Page titles in the app

- Capitalize when using the full page title: "the Reports page"
- Lowercase for generic mentions: "download reports"

### 2.5 Tone markers

- Always: "Contact our support team" (hyperlinked)
- Plan messaging: "The ____ page is available for ____ plan users."
- Emoji: keep it light and intentional

### 2.6 Capitalization & case

- Blog H1/headlines: Title Case if matching design system
- Help Center/Academy: sentence case
- Body copy: sentence case always
- CTAs: capitalize first word only ("Book a demo")
- Platforms: always capitalized (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- Content types: lowercase (stories, reels, carousels)

### 2.7 Punctuation

- Always use the Oxford Comma
- No periods on titles, headings, or CTAs
- Exclamation points sparingly

### 2.10 Numbers & statistics

- Round large currencies to one decimal for billions
- Round percentages to nearest whole number unless precision matters
- Make comparisons clear: what, direction, segment

### 2.11 Bullet lists

- Full sentence bullets: end with period
- Short phrase bullets: no period
- "Label + explanation" bullets: treat as one sentence

### 3. Prohibited Patterns

### 3.1 Overused marketing cliches

Avoid: "revolutionary," "game-changing," "cutting-edge," "seamless integration," "take your X to the next level," "one-stop solution," "best-in-class"

Replace with concrete descriptions: time saved, workflows simplified, revenue lift.

### 3.2 Retired Archive messaging (do not use)

- "Shoppable UGC Feeds" / "Shoppables" — deprecated product
- "Social commerce" as primary descriptor — use "UGC-powered e-commerce"
- "Archiving UGC" / "saving UGC" — use "detecting, collecting, and capturing UGC"
- "Tagged UGC" (unless specifically meaning @mentions) — use "UGC about your brand"
- "Library" for where content lives — use "Archive"
- "On-domain UGC" — retired
- "Coordination tax" — use "manual workflows" instead

### 3.3 Use carefully

- Avoid as primary labels: "media monitoring," "CRM," "reporting tool"
- Avoid over-promising: "complete solution," "viral guaranteed," "saves stories forever"
- Avoid "AI-magic" language — always explain what the AI does

## Part B – Archive Product Messaging & Positioning

### 12. Category & Product Model

Archive sits in: **Creator Marketing**

Three product areas:
1. **Social Listening** — detects and understands community posts across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
2. **Creator Activations** — finds, vets, and activates creators at scale
3. **Social Flirting** — finds posts worth commenting on, predicts virality, drafts comments

### 13. Core Messaging Pillars

1. **Capture everything** — detect more creator content, stories, mentions
2. **Automate the manual** — replace screenshots, Google Drive, Excel spreadsheets
3. **Prove ROI** — campaign reporting, competitor insights, quantified impact

### 14. Archive's AI & Smart AI Fields

- Always say "Archive's AI" (possessive)
- Explain specific actions: watches video, listens to audio, reads captions, detects brands, labels posts, predicts performance, drafts comments
- External name: **Smart AI Fields** (internal: Magic Fields)

### 16. Customer Language Word Bank

**Pains (use often):**
- everything is manual
- manually screenshotting stories
- screenshots in Google Drive
- tracking lives in Excel
- missing stories before they disappear
- content slipping through the cracks
- can't prove ROI
- finding creators is annoying

**Outcomes (use often):**
- capture everything
- track everything in one place
- automate manual workflows
- save time / save hours
- scale the creator program
- prove ROI to leadership
- find creators at scale

**Don't say → Say instead:**
- "save Stories" → "capture Stories before they disappear"
- "save content" → "capture content" or "detect content"

### 17. Feature Names & One-Liners

**Social Listening:**
- Archive Radar — AI video social listening that detects your brand, even without tags
- AI Insider — weekly AI recap that automates campaign reporting
- Smart AI Fields — AI auto-labels posts with products, campaigns, sentiment
- Competitor Insights — see competitor insights without doomscrolling
- Super Search — search your UGC by topic, product, or visual elements in seconds

**Creator Activations:**
- AI Creator Search — finds the right people, not just the same big names
- Creator Leaderboard — rank everyone who tags you by performance
- Gifting & Campaigns — automate seeding, track results
- Brand Safety Vetting — AI checks creator content against your rules
- Campaign Reporting — shows what's working and what to scale
- Usage & Whitelisting — get usage rights for ads

**Social Flirting:**
- Trend Prediction — AI predicts which posts are likely to go viral
- AI-Gen Comments — brand-safe, on-tone comments at scale
- Comment Reporting — see how comments drive reach, EMV, engagement

### 19. Product & Messaging Guardrails

- Do NOT oversell: affiliates, TikTok Live metrics, DM inbox, payments/negotiation workflows
- Stories: use "detect" or "capture," never "save forever"
- Creator count: avoid "30M creators" — focus on finding specific, relevant creators
- Coverage claims: scope to specific platforms and surfaces
- Be honest about what's shipped vs aspirational

**Quick mental checklist:**
- Am I clearly in Creator Marketing?
- Did I anchor in Social Listening / Creator Activations / Social Flirting?
- Did I describe what Archive's AI actually does?
- Did I lean on capture everything / automate the manual / prove ROI?
- Did I use real customer language?
- Did I avoid banned / retired phrases?
- Am I honest about what's shipped vs aspirational?
