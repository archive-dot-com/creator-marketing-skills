# Contact Fit Principles

Principles for classifying whether a contact's job title is relevant to our ICP.

**Note:** The company should already be pre-qualified. For company-level classification, see Company Fit Principles.

**Note:** Segment definitions (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise) are defined separately in ICP & Segment Definitions. Contact Fit and Segment are independent classifications often used together.

## Scoring Framework

| Score | Label        | Meaning                       |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 4     | Excellent    | Strong ICP fit                |
| 3     | Good         | Solid ICP fit with some gaps  |
| 2     | Probably Bad | Weak fit, likely not ICP      |
| 1     | Awful        | Not ICP                       |

## Core Philosophy

1. **Decision criteria adapt based on Company Type** (Agency vs Brand) **and Segment** (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
2. **Consider LinkedIn background context**, not just the current title — a "VP Marketing" with campaign background is more valuable than one with broad/general experience
3. **Function specificity matters more at Mid-Market** — look for explicit keywords: Influencer/Creator, Social Media, Community, UGC, Brand Partnerships, Social Commerce

---

## Score 4: Excellent

**For Agencies:**
- Client-facing roles: Account Director, Partnership Manager, Business Development Director
- Senior Account Manager (valuable due to client proximity)
- Director+ in marketing, digital, social, influencer functions

**For Brands:**
- Marketing, Digital, E-Commerce, Brand, Social, Influencer roles
- Community engagement and social media management roles
- Director, Head, VP, Senior Manager or above
- Executives: Founder, Owner, CEO, President, CMO (especially valuable at SMB level)

**Segment adjustments:**
- **SMB:** Presidents/Owners in marketing-adjacent roles are automatically Score 4
- **Mid-Market:** Must have explicit function keywords (Influencer/Creator, Social Media, Community, UGC, Brand Partnerships, Social Commerce). Generic marketing titles without these → Score 2-3
- **Enterprise:** VP+ strongly preferred, be more selective with execution roles

---

## Score 3: Good

- Roles that partially match Score 4 criteria but lack seniority or function specificity
- Marketing-adjacent roles with some creator/influencer relevance
- **For Agencies:** Internal creative/strategy roles with occasional client contact
- **For Mid-Market Brands:** Marketing titles with partial function keywords; senior individual contributors in relevant functions

---

## Score 2: Probably Bad

- Community Managers (often too junior or vague)
- CSR/Social Impact roles blended with marketing (e.g. "Cause Marketing Lead")
- Ambiguous or vague roles: "Experience", "Programming", "Content Production"
- **For Agencies:** Internal creative/strategy roles without client contact
- **For Enterprise:** Senior Manager roles in non-core departments
- **For Mid-Market Brands:** Generic marketing titles without function keywords; CSR roles with social component ("Social Consciousness", "Social Impact")

---

## Score 1: Awful

**Universal exclusions:**
- CSR, Philanthropy, DEI, Volunteerism, Employee Engagement
- Sales, Business Development, Finance, HR, IT, Legal
- Execution-only roles: Designer, Copywriter, Intern, Specialist

**For Brands:**
- Pure PR/Communications roles (limited marketing overlap)

**For Mid-Market Brands:**
- Sales-focused marketing roles without social/influencer component (Retail Sales, B2B Sales, Channel Marketing)
- Content Production roles unless explicitly UGC-focused
- Generic channels/partnerships without social/influencer specification
