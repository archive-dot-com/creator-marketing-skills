    🎯 We need to create a shortlist of influencers to contact. This includes searching for influencers and qualitative/quantitative vetting. We need their emails.
    
    </aside>
    
    - For cold influencers, we’ll find influencers, vet them, and then get their contact info. Agencies and platforms help streamline this process.
    - Vetting is very important. We need to filter/vet by location, demographics, content, vibe, and number of additional factors. Different teams, campaigns, and programs have different levels of vetting.
    - For warm influencers, things are simpler. We go through our CRM to find previously-activated influencers that would be a good fit for our new campaign. We look for ‘fit’ and ‘performance’. We typically have contact info since we already worked with them.
    - Building lists of new influencers is one of the most manual and time consuming things our team handles.

    - Once we have a list, we’re going to reach out to every single influencer. Sometimes, getting their contact info is hard and manual. Outreach can vary from sending a couple DM’s a day to building out large-scale, cold email sequences. The primary goal here is to get a response from the influencer.
    - Some influencers don’t reply to the first email/DM, so it’s important to track replies & send follow ups.

    🎯 Go from an influencer reply to a verbal agreement for the activation.
    
    </aside>
    
    - Our process here varies massively depending on the type of activation.
    - In the simplest case, if we’re doing bulk outreach for gifting, all influencers really need to do is say ‘sounds good’ and submit and address. There are no strings attached.
    - In a more complicated scenario, we have to explain the deliverables, incentives, and do a few rounds of negotiation, and agree on timelines.
    - We usually need to direct message or email with the influencer, either over IG DMs, email, or through our influencer CRM’s direct messaging feature.
    - We might even jump on a phone call if it’s a bigger influencer and more involved brief or deliverable.

    🎯 Objective: Turn verbal commitments into formal opt-ins or signed contracts.
    
    </aside>
    
    - For big important campaigns, we are making our influencer sign a contract. We’ll either manually create a PDF and email it to the influencer, send a docusign, or use Grin/CIQ to generate a link they can use to review and sign.
    - For smaller influencers/deals, we sometimes use a Google or Airtable form. We simply need them to fill in the form.
    - Sometimes, all of this just happens of IG/TT DMs or emails. Once I get the commitment, I’ll just save the info on our end.
    - In this step, we also collect any info we need like their address, gift/product preferences, etc…

    ✅ Signed contracts or form submissions. Everything we need from the influencer to get going with the campaign/program.

    </aside>
    
    - Most of the time, we can send product directly from Shopify. Sometimes, if we’re sending a custom box, I download a CSV of the addresses and upload them to my 3PL.
    - It’s helpful to keep track of the tracking info so we can follow up with influencers who haven’t posted & re-ship packages that did not deliver. When we’re sending 1000s of gifts, this can be painful.
    - I also need to map our products/skus to the influencer preferences that we collected.
    - When the product goes out, I like to send influencers and email with their tracking info.

    <aside>
    🎯 Objective: Generate codes & links for all my influencers so they can drive sales and so we can track sales.
    
    </aside>
    
    - When we are doing brand campaigns, we don’t use Codes, Links, and UTMs. We sometimes want influencers to post more authentic content, without any CTAs or links/codes. But with affiliate programs or campaigns/programs that aim to drive sales, we lean heavily on links and codes.
    - We know that many content formats like IG Reels and TikTok videos can’t have links, so we push influencers to use them in Stories and in Bio. In those cases, we’ll let influencers use their custom codes.
    - To start, our manager will configure settings for the codes & links. The discounts, the offers, the naming convention. Our manager will sometimes set up a different configuration for different programs or different tiers in the program.
    - We need to install some javascript on our website so that we can attribute clicks, sales, and other on-site events to the right influencer.
    - We then need to generate a code for each influencer. Sometimes codes get leaked, which is a huge issue. We have to cancel the code and make a new one. Sometimes influencers ask for the same code, i.e. Paul10, which is also an issue.
    - Once the code/link is generated, we need to send it to the influencer so they can use it in their post.
    
    <aside>
    ✅ Links/Codes are generate, assigned, and sent to influencers.

    Objective: Create a document that outlines the expectations for the campaign. 
    
    </aside>
    
    - When we are doing bulk seeding, we don’t send briefs, since it’s more of a no-strings attached, no expectation.
    - We will create a brief for the campaign/program that covers:
        - Content guidelines
        - Do’s & Dont’s
        - Brand Guidelines
        - References
        - Timeline & process
    - Most the time, the brief is for a specific campaign. For evergreen programs, like gifting or ambassador programs, we might have a new brief every month or make some changes.

    <aside>
    🎯 Objective: Review the influencer’s content before it goes live. Either approve or send feedback.
    
    </aside>
    
    - For seeding campaigns, where there are no expectations, we won’t need to review/approve content. We’re just hoping influencer post. For large-scale programs, we also don’t review & approve content because a) we don’t have time and b) it adds too much friction for the influencer.
    - First of all, we need to receive the content. Influencers will either DM/or email us a draft, or submit it via our Influence Plaform.
    - From their, we’ll review it and decide if we like it and if hits everything we outlined in the brief.
    - If things are good, we’ll approve the content and let the influencer know.
    - If things are not good, we need to reject it, and send the influencer a message with feedback so they can resubmit another draft. This requires back and forth communication with influencers.

    </aside>
    
    - After activating influencers, we need to track them to see if they post.
    - Some brands use platforms like Tribe & Grin to do this, but it’s clunky and sometimes misses content. Other brands do this completely manually, which can be very manual.
    - Some teams go as far as checking all of their activated influencer’s stories daily to make sure they don’t miss any posts.

    <aside>
    🎯 Objective: Secure usage rights to content so it can be repurposed and keep a log.
    
    </aside>
    
    - We negotiate Usage Rights in three different ways:
        - **Specific activations**: post 2 reels this month and btw we want rights
        - **Joining a program:** you need to post 2x a month and we get rights to all that content
        - **After UGC is posted:**  we like this post, can we have/buy rights?
    - Getting usage rights is typically very manual. It takes time to find the content, ping the influencer, get them to reply, etc….
    - It’s also hard to track what rights we have, for what platform, and for how long. This is a major pain point for our paid social team, who sometimes have no way of knowing if they need to renew usage rights because it’s expired.
    - In the agreement, we usually include where we can use the content, how much we’re paying, the duration of rights, and any ability to extend.
    
    <aside>
    ✅ Usage rights agreement.

    🎯 Objective: Identify content to whitelist & get access.
    
    </aside>
    
    - We’re seeing much better ad performance when we whitelist creators. It’s a lot of work to get creators to auth into Meta to give us access. Spark ads (from TikTok) are also very manual.
    - Meta: We’re currently sending influencers a list of instructions via PDF, and it always goes wrong. It’s very time-consuming.
    - TikTok: We have to request Spark Codes for reach post we want to whitelist.
    
    <aside>
    ✅ The agreement is made & content is accessible in the brand’s Meta & TikTok Ad Accounts.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    🤖 We need to streamline this flow & then things can be negotiated by agents. We could even have a GPT Screenshare tool that walks influencers through the setup. Spark codes can be automated through IG dm’s and a conversation bot.

    - When influencers or customers post, it’s really important that we engage with it. We want them to feel like they are part of the community. A simple story like or quick reply goes a long way. And for Reels or TikToks, we like to leave comments.
    - We need to be careful with automation here because we don’t want to look like bots. We also need to make sure that positive posts and negative posts are handled appropriately.

    🎯 Objective: For every post that goes live, log the metrics and engagement for reporting.
    
    </aside>
    
    - When we have access to an influencer platform like Tribe & Grin, we’ll use that to keep track of engagement data.
    - For IG Stories, we will either estimate it or DM Influencers to ask for a screenshot of their post insights. We’ll parse this manually and put it into a spreadsheet. Sometimes, our Influencer Platform (i.e. Grin) will let influencer connect their account so that we pull story metrics. Influencers don’t like this and it adds a lot of friction.
    - If we’re using an affiliate platform, we can also get click data by looking at UTMs and we can get purchase data like revenue/# of orders.

    - Program Reporting: Keeping tabs on our (hopefully) growing program. Are we getting more creators posting? More posts? More metrics? We need to dive in as well to be able to understand what’s working.
    - Weekly/Monthly/Yearly Reporting: Reporting on overall performance, especially with period-over-period comparison. How’s this week vs last month? This month vs last month?
