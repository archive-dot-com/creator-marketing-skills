# ICP & Segment Definitions

## Overview

This document defines how to classify prospects and what to pitch them. Use the classification rules to determine segment, then refer to the feature priorities for that segment to guide your sales conversation.

## Segment Classification Rules

Classification follows an "any one exceeds = bump up" rule. If ANY metric exceeds the threshold for a higher segment, classify at that higher segment.

### Brands

| Segment | Revenue | Employees | Instagram Followers | Rule |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| **SMB** | <$50M | <50 | <100K | Must meet ALL three |
| **Mid-Market** | ≥$50M | ≥50 | ≥100K | ANY ONE exceeds SMB threshold |
| **Enterprise** | ≥$1B | ≥1,000 | ≥5M | ANY ONE exceeds threshold |

### Agencies

| Segment | Revenue | Employees | Other | Rule |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|------|
| **SMB** | <$50M | <50 | — | Must meet BOTH |
| **Mid-Market** | ≥$50M | ≥50 | — | ANY ONE exceeds SMB threshold |
| **Enterprise** | ≥$250M | ≥500 | Big 6 holding company | ANY ONE exceeds threshold |

**Big 6 holding companies**: Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, IPG, Havas, Dentsu. Any agency under these umbrellas is automatically Enterprise.

### Missing Data Handling

- Check LinkedIn for employee count
- Use available data points—only ONE metric is needed to classify upward
- When in doubt, use the highest classifiable segment based on available data

## Feature Priorities by Segment

### SMB Brands & Agencies

**Priority**: 1) Sourcing → 2) Campaign Tracking → 3) Social Listening

Sourcing new creators is the top priority—SMB teams are building their influencer programs from scratch. Start with Creator Search and Competitor Insights to find and recruit creators. Campaign tracking (especially gifting) comes second for teams running seeding programs. Social Listening becomes valuable once they have enough organic mentions to matter.

### Mid-Market Brands & Agencies

Mid-Market has two distinct buyer personas with different priorities:

#### Influencer Teams

**Priority**: 1) Social Listening/Content Capture → 2) Reporting → 3) Sourcing (secondary)

Social Listening with Magic Fields is the top priority—capturing all creator content including untagged mentions and Stories before they expire. Reporting tools help prove ROI across the creator roster. Creator Search is secondary—only relevant when expanding into new niches or replacing underperformers.

#### Social Teams

**Priority**: 1) Social Listening → 2) Social Flirting

Social Listening with Magic Fields is the top priority—Mid-Market brands get 1,000-10,000+ UGC/month and can't manually search through everything. Magic Fields auto-categorize by campaign, product, brand safety, and more. Social Flirting lets them proactively engage with viral content and build community presence.

### Enterprise Brands & Agencies

Enterprise also has two distinct buyer personas:

#### Influencer Teams

**Priority**: 1) Creator Vetting

Creator Vetting is the biggest business case at Enterprise scale. Brands pay agencies $200+ per creator for manual vetting; agencies spend massive labor hours on the same. Archive's AI scans entire creator histories against custom brand safety rules—frame-by-frame video, audio, and caption analysis.

#### Social Teams

**Priority**: 1) Social Flirting → 2) Trends Reporting → 3) Social Listening with Magic Fields

Social Flirting is most important for Enterprise social teams who need to be part of cultural conversations. Trends Reporting provides executive-ready insights and crisis monitoring—analyzing millions of UGC pieces to surface what matters. Social Listening with Magic Fields handles the volume problem—10,000+ monthly mentions need AI filtering to find what matters.
