# Company Fit Principles

Principles for classifying whether a company is a good fit for our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

**Note:** This evaluates the company itself, not individual contacts. For contact-level classification, see Contact Fit Principles.

**Note:** Segment definitions (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise) are defined separately in ICP & Segment Definitions. Company Fit and Segment are independent classifications often used together.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Default to generosity for consumer brands**
2. **Assume consumer brands leverage creators/influencers** unless clearly contradicted
3. **When unsure between 3 and 4 for a consumer brand, choose 4**
4. **Be more conservative with B2B and infrastructure companies**
5. **Focus on the primary business model** when signals are mixed
6. **If evidence is sparse, score conservatively** — except follow the generosity principle for consumer brands

---

## Score 4: Excellent

**Brands:**
- Consumer brands selling physical products DTC or omnichannel
- Especially: beauty, fashion, wellness, food, lifestyle, jewelry
- Strong consumer/brand storytelling signals
- Explicit or implicit UGC/creator/influencer/community relevance

**Agencies:**
- Core services are influencer marketing, social, PR, creator campaigns, brand partnerships
- DTC-focused agencies

---

## Score 3: Good

**Brands:**
- Consumer brands with weaker/less explicit creator emphasis
- Consumer-focused B2B SaaS
- Large consumer marketplaces/platforms

**Agencies:**
- Meaningful but not primary influencer/social function
- Hybrid influencer + performance agencies

---

## Score 2: Probably Bad

**Brands:**
- Consumer product companies primarily wholesale/retail/marketplace-based rather than DTC
- Industrial/technical consumer products where brand marketing is secondary

**Agencies:**
- Focused on performance, SEO, or dev with minimal influencer/social relevance

**Other:**
- Adjacent B2B companies serving brands without creator/influencer focus

---

## Score 1: Awful

**Automatic exclusions** — if any clearly apply, assign Score 1:

- Distributors, wholesalers, or resellers
- Non-primary domains (subdomains, regional domains, microsites)
- Marketplace sellers (individual sellers on Amazon, Etsy, etc.)
- Franchise locations (individual franchisees)
- EdTech and universities (no exceptions)
- Car dealerships (auto OEMs may be considered separately)
- Pure B2B infrastructure, IT, logistics, or manufacturing
- Companies with no consumer-facing brand or marketing component

**Brands:**
- Pure B2B SaaS/infrastructure
- Industrial/manufacturing/logistics

**Agencies:**
