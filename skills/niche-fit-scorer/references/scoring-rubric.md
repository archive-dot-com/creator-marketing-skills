## Dimension Definitions & Scoring Criteria

Each dimension is scored 1-10. The final Niche Fit Score is a weighted average.

### Dimension 1: Content Topical Alignment (Weight: 30%)

How closely does the creator's content match the brand's category, product type, and messaging themes?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | 80%+ of recent posts are in the brand's exact category. Creator is known for this niche. Content themes overlap directly with campaign messaging. |
| 7-8 | 60-80% topical overlap. Creator covers the category regularly but also posts adjacent content. |
| 5-6 | 40-60% overlap. Category appears in content mix but isn't the primary focus. |
| 3-4 | 20-40% overlap. Occasional category mentions but the creator's identity is in a different space. |
| 1-2 | Under 20% overlap. Creator rarely or never covers this category. Partnership would feel forced. |

**How to assess:** Review the creator's last 20-30 posts. Count how many directly relate to the brand's category. Check bio keywords, hashtags used, and recurring content themes.

**What to look for:**
- Product types featured (skincare, apparel, supplements, food)
- Recurring topics and themes in captions
- Hashtag patterns (niche-specific vs. generic)
- Content pillars the creator has established
- Whether category content is organic or only sponsored

### Dimension 2: Audience Demographic Match (Weight: 25%)

How closely does the creator's audience mirror the brand's target consumer?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Audience demographics strongly match the brand's target: age, gender, location, and income signals all align. |
| 7-8 | 3 of 4 demographic factors align. Minor gaps in one area (e.g., slightly older skew than target). |
| 5-6 | 2 of 4 factors align. Audience partially overlaps but notable mismatches exist. |
| 3-4 | 1 of 4 factors aligns. Audience is mostly different from the brand's target. |
| 1-2 | No meaningful demographic overlap. The creator's audience is fundamentally different from the target consumer. |

**Demographic factors to evaluate:**
- **Age range**: Does the audience age match the brand's core customer? (e.g., a Gen Z skincare brand needs a creator whose audience is 18-28, not 35-50)
- **Gender split**: Does it match the brand's customer base? (e.g., a women's fashion brand needs predominantly female audience)
- **Geography**: Does the audience live where the brand sells? (especially for DTC brands with limited shipping or retail footprint)
- **Income signals**: Does the content suggest an audience that can afford the product? (luxury vs. budget positioning)

**Where to find this data:**
- Creator's own analytics (if they share a media kit)
- Third-party tools (HypeAuditor, Modash, Social Blade)
- Proxy signals: comment language, follower profiles, engagement patterns
- If no data is available, infer from content style, brands previously partnered with, and product price points featured

### Dimension 3: Brand Voice & Aesthetic Compatibility (Weight: 20%)

Does the creator's tone, visual style, and communication approach match the brand's identity?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Creator's content could pass as brand content. Tone, visual style, and values are naturally aligned. No adaptation needed. |
| 7-8 | Strong alignment with minor differences. Creator could produce on-brand content with light briefing. |
| 5-6 | Moderate alignment. The creator's style is adjacent but would need a detailed brief and some creative compromise. |
| 3-4 | Weak alignment. Significant gaps in tone or visual style. The partnership would require the creator to step outside their normal voice. |
| 1-2 | No alignment. The creator's style actively contradicts the brand identity. Partnership would look inauthentic to both audiences. |

**Evaluate across these sub-factors:**

| Sub-Factor | What to check |
|------------|---------------|
| Visual style | Lighting, color palette, editing style, production quality |
| Tone of voice | Casual vs. polished, humorous vs. serious, educational vs. entertaining |
| Values signaling | Sustainability, inclusivity, luxury, accessibility, science-backed claims |
| Language level | Technical vs. conversational, slang usage, vocabulary complexity |
| Platform behavior | How they interact with followers, community tone in comments |

### Dimension 4: Niche Authority & Credibility (Weight: 15%)

Is this creator recognized as a trusted voice in the relevant niche? Would their audience believe a recommendation in this category?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Creator is a recognized expert or go-to voice in this niche. Audience actively seeks their recommendations. Past brand partnerships in the category performed well. |
| 7-8 | Creator has established credibility through consistent content. Audience trusts their opinion in this space. |
| 5-6 | Creator has some credibility but isn't a niche authority. Recommendations would be accepted but not actively sought. |
| 3-4 | Creator is outside their expertise zone. Audience might question why they're promoting this product. |
| 1-2 | No credible connection to the niche. Recommendation would feel like a paid ad with no authentic basis. |

**Credibility signals:**
- Engagement quality on category-specific posts (thoughtful comments vs. generic emoji)
- Audience questions in comments asking for product recommendations
- Previous brand partnerships in the same category and how they were received
- Creator's personal story or credentials related to the niche (e.g., licensed esthetician for skincare)
- Whether they use, review, or reference similar products organically (not just when paid)

### Dimension 5: Audience Engagement Quality (Weight: 10%)

Does the creator's audience actively engage in ways that suggest purchase intent and genuine interest?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | High engagement rate for their tier. Comments include product questions, "where did you get that," saved/shared at high rates. Low fake follower signals. |
| 7-8 | Above-average engagement. Mix of genuine and surface-level interaction. Community is active. |
| 5-6 | Average engagement. Some genuine interaction but nothing suggesting strong purchase intent. |
| 3-4 | Below-average engagement. Comments are mostly generic (fire emoji, "goals"). Low save/share signals. |
| 1-2 | Very low engagement or suspicious patterns. High bot/fake follower indicators. Comments don't match audience profile. |

**Engagement benchmarks by platform and tier:**

| Tier | Instagram | TikTok | YouTube |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Nano (1K-10K) | 3-5% | 6-10% | 4-8% |
| Micro (10K-100K) | 1.5-3% | 3-6% | 2-5% |
| Mid (100K-500K) | 1-2% | 2-4% | 1.5-3% |
| Macro (500K-1M) | 0.8-1.5% | 1.5-3% | 1-2% |
| Mega (1M+) | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 0.5-1.5% |

## Worked Examples

### Example A: Strong Fit (Score: 8.5/10)

**Brand:** Clean beauty brand, $30-60 price range, targets women 22-35, minimalist aesthetic, ingredient-transparency positioning.

**Creator:** 45K followers on Instagram. Bio: "Esthetician | Clean beauty obsessed | Ingredient breakdowns." Last 20 posts: 16 about skincare (3 clean beauty reviews, 4 ingredient explainers, 5 routine posts, 4 skin concern content). Visual style: bright, minimal, close-up skin shots.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content Topical Alignment | 9 | 80% skincare content, clean beauty is a core theme, ingredient content maps perfectly to brand positioning |
| Audience Demographic Match | 8 | Female-skewed, 24-32 age range per media kit, US-based, mid-range product features suggest matching spending power. Slightly younger than brand's core but strong overlap. |
| Brand Voice & Aesthetic | 9 | Minimalist visuals match brand. Educational, science-forward tone aligns with ingredient-transparency positioning. |
| Niche Authority | 8 | Licensed esthetician credential. Comments include "what do you think of X ingredient?" — audience trusts category opinions. |
| Engagement Quality | 8 | 3.2% engagement rate (strong for micro tier). Comments are product-specific, not just emoji. |
| **Weighted Total** | **8.55** | |

**Verdict:** Strong niche fit. Creator's expertise, content focus, and audience profile all align with the brand. Minor gap: audience skews slightly younger than brand's core 25-35 demo. Brief should emphasize the 28-35 age range to calibrate content.

### Example B: Moderate Fit (Score: 5.8/10)

**Brand:** Premium athleisure brand, $80-150 price range, targets women 28-40, aspirational lifestyle, "performance meets style."

**Creator:** 120K followers on TikTok. Bio: "Fitness girlie | Morning routines | Life in NYC." Last 20 posts: 6 fitness content, 8 lifestyle/day-in-my-life, 3 food content, 3 fashion hauls (fast fashion).

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content Topical Alignment | 5 | Fitness is present but not dominant. Fashion content features budget brands, not premium athleisure. Category is adjacent, not core. |
| Audience Demographic Match | 7 | Female, 25-35, urban — good demographic match. But fast fashion content signals audience may not convert at $100+ price points. |
| Brand Voice & Aesthetic | 5 | Energetic and casual — not wrong, but more "fun" than "aspirational." Fast-paced TikTok editing vs. brand's polished aesthetic. |
| Niche Authority | 4 | Fitness content exists but creator isn't a fitness authority. No credentials, certifications, or deep niche expertise. Audience follows for lifestyle, not fitness recommendations. |
| Engagement Quality | 7 | 4.1% engagement (good for mid-tier TikTok). Mix of genuine and surface comments. Some "where is that from?" on fashion posts. |
| **Weighted Total** | **5.55** | |

**Verdict:** Moderate fit with significant gaps. The creator reaches the right demographic but lacks niche authority in premium athleisure. Content style doesn't match brand positioning. If the brand is looking for broad awareness, this might work — but for niche credibility and conversion, the fit is too loose.

### Example C: Poor Fit (Score: 2.9/10)

**Brand:** Organic baby food brand, $5-8 per pouch, targets parents 28-40, "real ingredients, no shortcuts."

**Creator:** 500K followers on Instagram. Bio: "Travel | Fashion | Living my best life." Last 20 posts: 10 travel content, 6 fashion, 3 restaurant/food, 1 sponsored wellness post.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Content Topical Alignment | 1 | Zero parenting, baby, or food content. No lifestyle signals suggesting parenthood. Category mismatch is complete. |
| Audience Demographic Match | 4 | Age range may partially overlap, but audience follows for travel/fashion — not parenting content. No indication they're parents or baby food buyers. |
| Brand Voice & Aesthetic | 3 | Aspirational travel aesthetic is too far from "real ingredients, kitchen-table warmth" brand voice. |
| Niche Authority | 1 | No parenting credibility. Audience would question why this creator is endorsing baby food. |
| Engagement Quality | 5 | Decent engagement rate for macro tier, but engagement won't transfer to a completely off-category product. |
| **Weighted Total** | **2.35** | |

**Verdict:** Poor fit. This is a reach-based vanity pick, not a niche fit. The creator has zero connection to the brand's category, audience needs, or positioning. Even with 500K followers, the audience overlap with "parents buying organic baby food" is negligible.

## Red Flags That Override Scores

Even if a creator scores well on the rubric, the following red flags should drop the overall score or add a warning:

| Red Flag | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **>25% fake or bot followers** | Invalidates engagement quality score. Drop to 1/10 on Dimension 5. |
| **Recent brand safety incident** | Flag for manual review regardless of niche score. Note in rationale. |
| **Exclusive competitor partnership** | Automatic conflict. Note as disqualifier even if niche fit is perfect. |
| **Content is 90%+ sponsored** | Audience treats feed as ad space. Niche authority erodes when everything is paid. Drop Dimension 4 by 2-3 points. |
| **Engagement rate below 50% of tier benchmark** | Signals audience disengagement or inflated follower count. Drop Dimension 5 by 2-3 points. |
| **Creator has never mentioned or used this product category organically** | Recommendation will read as a pure ad. Drop Dimension 4 by 2 points unless creator has strong cross-category credibility. |
| **Audience geography mismatch >60%** | If brand only ships to US and creator's audience is 60%+ international, even perfect niche alignment won't convert. Drop Dimension 2 by 3 points. |
