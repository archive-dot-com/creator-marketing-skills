## Response Rate Benchmarks

| Outreach Type | Average Response Rate | Top-Performer Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generic copy-paste email | 5-10% | -- | Baseline; avoid this |
| Personalized email (name + content ref) | 20-30% | 40%+ | Minimum viable personalization |
| Highly personalized email (specific post + why) | 35-50% | 60%+ | Worth the extra 2 minutes per message |
| Instagram DM (nano/micro) | 25-40% | 50%+ | Works best under 50K followers |
| Instagram DM (macro 100K+) | 5-15% | 25% | Often managed by team; email preferred |
| TikTok DM | 15-30% | 40% | Must be mutual followers; lower ceiling |
| YouTube email (from description) | 15-25% | 35% | Professional tone expected |
| Multi-channel (email + DM follow-up) | 40-55% | 65%+ | Highest-performing approach |
| With video introduction | +30-40% lift | -- | Short branded video under 15 seconds |

**Key benchmarks:**
- First follow-up adds ~21% to reply rate
- Second follow-up adds another ~25% chance
- Multi-channel outreach (email + social) increases response by up to 287% vs. single-channel
- Majority of positive responses come on the 2nd or 3rd touch, not the first

## Platform Channel Guide

### Email
- **Best for:** Paid partnerships, macro/mega creators, formal proposals, creators who list email in bio
- **Tone:** Professional but warm; colleague-to-colleague, not corporate-to-vendor
- **Length:** 100-200 words for initial outreach; up to 300 for detailed proposals
- **Structure:** Subject line + greeting + 1-2 sentence brand intro + why them + what you are proposing + clear CTA
- **Subject line:** Required; make it specific (not "Collaboration Opportunity")
- **Attachments:** Link to brand deck or one-pager; never attach files on first touch

### Instagram DM
- **Best for:** Nano/micro creators (under 50K), creators who are active on Instagram, casual first touch
- **Tone:** Casual, direct, warm; like texting a professional contact
- **Length:** Under 120 words; 3-5 short sentences ideal
- **Structure:** Compliment + who you are + what you want + easy CTA
- **Formatting:** No bullet points or headers; short paragraphs; emojis sparingly and only if the creator uses them
- **Tip:** Engage with their content (like, comment) 2-3 days before DMing

### TikTok DM
- **Best for:** TikTok-native creators, trend-driven campaigns, short-form content partnerships
- **Tone:** Most casual of all channels; match TikTok energy
- **Length:** Under 80 words; get to the point fast
- **Structure:** Quick hook + who you are + one-sentence pitch + CTA
- **Constraint:** Must be mutual followers to DM; often better to use the email listed in TikTok bio
- **Alternative:** Use TikTok's collaboration email button if available

### YouTube Email
- **Best for:** Long-form content partnerships, product integrations, sponsored segments
- **Tone:** Professional; YouTube creators expect business-level communication
- **Length:** 150-250 words; more detail expected than DM channels
- **Structure:** Subject line + specific video reference + brand intro + partnership concept + compensation range + CTA
- **Source:** Use the email from the "About" tab or channel description
- **Note:** YouTube creators typically have the longest response times (5-10 business days)

### X (Twitter) DM
- **Best for:** Quick initial contact, creators who are very active on X, commentary/thought-leader types
- **Tone:** Brief, direct, slightly witty if appropriate
- **Length:** Under 60 words
- **Structure:** Hook + who you are + one line pitch + "Can I send more details via email?"
- **Use case:** Best as a bridge to email, not a standalone outreach channel

## Sequence Timing Framework

### Standard 3-Touch Sequence (Most Common)

| Touch | Channel | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Primary (email or DM) | Day 0 | Initial pitch with personalization hook |
| 2 | Same channel | Day 3-5 | Follow-up with new angle or value add |
| 3 | Same or secondary channel | Day 10-14 | Final touch with easy out ("breakup") |

### Extended 5-Touch Sequence (High-Value Creators)

| Touch | Channel | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Primary channel | Day 0 | Initial pitch with personalization hook |
| 2 | Social engagement | Day 1-2 | Like/comment on recent content (warm signal) |
| 3 | Primary channel | Day 4-5 | Follow-up with social proof or new angle |
| 4 | Secondary channel | Day 8-10 | Cross-channel touch with brief note |
| 5 | Primary channel | Day 14-17 | Final touch with easy out |

### Quick-Turn 2-Touch Sequence (Time-Sensitive Campaigns)

| Touch | Channel | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DM (fastest response) | Day 0 | Urgent but respectful pitch with deadline context |
| 2 | Same channel or email | Day 2-3 | One follow-up with simplified ask |

## Subject Line Patterns

Effective subject lines for creator outreach emails, sorted by pattern type:

| Pattern | Example | Why It Works |
|---|---|---|
| Specific content reference | "Loved your [video topic] series" | Shows genuine familiarity |
| Mutual connection | "[Name] suggested I reach out" | Social proof and trust |
| Direct value statement | "[Brand] x [Creator Name] — paid collab" | No ambiguity about intent |
| Question format | "Would [product] fit your [content niche]?" | Invites curiosity |
| Brand + creator name | "[Brand] + [Creator] partnership idea" | Clear, professional |

**Subject lines to avoid:**
- "Collaboration Opportunity" (generic, easily ignored)
- "We love your content!" (sounds automated)
- "Partnership Proposal" (too formal, no hook)
- "Quick question" (clickbait energy)
- All caps or excessive punctuation

## Personalization Hook Library

Use these categories to find the right personalization angle for each creator.

### Tier 1: Content-Specific (Strongest)
- Reference a specific post, video, or series by name
- Quote something they said in a caption or video
- Mention a trend they started or participated in
- Note a content format they do uniquely well

**Example:** "Your 'what I actually eat in a day' series is exactly the kind of honest content our audience responds to — especially the episode where you called out misleading portion sizes."

### Tier 2: Audience-Specific (Strong)
- Note something about their audience (engagement quality, comment themes)
- Reference their community's values or interests
- Mention how their audience overlaps with your target customer

**Example:** "The comments on your last skincare routine post were full of people asking about clean ingredient alternatives — that is exactly the conversation our brand lives in."

### Tier 3: Brand-Fit Specific (Good)
- Explain the specific reason their aesthetic or values align with your brand
- Reference a previous brand partnership they did well
- Note their content style matches your campaign vision

**Example:** "The way you styled the [competitor product] in your apartment tour felt effortless — that is the exact vibe we are going for with our spring collection."

### Tier 4: Timing-Specific (Situational)
- Reference a milestone (follower count, anniversary, launch)
- Tie to a seasonal moment or trend
- Connect to something they recently posted about wanting to try

**Example:** "Congrats on hitting 50K — your growth in the sustainable fashion space has been impressive. We would love to be part of what you are building."

## Message Length Guidelines

| Channel | Touch 1 | Touch 2 | Touch 3+ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email | 100-200 words | 75-125 words | 50-75 words |
| Instagram DM | 60-120 words | 40-80 words | 30-50 words |
| TikTok DM | 40-80 words | 30-60 words | 20-40 words |
| YouTube email | 150-250 words | 100-150 words | 75-100 words |
| X DM | 30-60 words | 20-40 words | 15-30 words |

**Rule:** Each follow-up should be shorter than the previous touch. Respect the creator's time more with each contact.

## Compensation Framing by Tier

How to frame compensation in outreach based on creator tier and relationship type:

| Creator Tier | Follower Range | How to Frame Compensation |
|---|---|---|
| Nano | 1K-10K | Lead with product gifting; mention "paid opportunity" if budget allows |
| Micro | 10K-50K | State "paid collaboration" clearly; range is fine ("$200-500 per post") |
| Mid-Tier | 50K-250K | Be specific about budget; they expect professional terms |
| Macro | 250K-1M | State budget range upfront; mention usage rights and exclusivity terms |
| Mega | 1M+ | Route through management; lead with brand vision, follow with business terms |

**What to include in first touch vs. later:**
- Touch 1: Mention compensation exists ("This is a paid partnership" or "We would love to send you [product]")
- Touch 2-3: Add specifics if they engage ("Budget is $X per deliverable" or "We are offering product + $X")
- Never leave compensation ambiguous past the second touch

## Follow-Up Angle Rotation

Never repeat the same pitch. Each follow-up should introduce a new angle:

| Follow-Up # | Angle | Example Opening |
|---|---|---|
| 1st follow-up | Social proof | "A few creators in [niche] have already joined — [name] just posted her first piece and it outperformed her average by 3x" |
| 1st follow-up | Value add | "Forgot to mention — we also handle all product shipping and creative direction is completely yours" |
| 2nd follow-up | Simplified ask | "Totally understand if the timing is off. If you are ever open to trying [product], I would love to send some over — no strings" |
| 2nd follow-up | Urgency (honest) | "Campaign kicks off [date] — wanted to check in one more time before we finalize the creator roster" |
| Final touch | Breakup with door open | "Last note from me on this — if the timing or fit is not right, completely understand. We will keep following your work and would love to connect on a future campaign" |
